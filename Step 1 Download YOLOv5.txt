Step 1: Download YOLOv5
Download the ZIP File:
Go to the YOLOv5 GitHub page.
Click on the green “Code” button.
Select “Download ZIP”.
Extract the ZIP File:
Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to a directory of your choice.
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
Navigate to the directory where you extracted the YOLOv5 files.
Install Required Packages:
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Download Pretrained Weights
Pretrained Weights:
YOLOv5 provides several pretrained weights (e.g., yolov5s.pt, yolov5m.pt, yolov5l.pt, yolov5x.pt). These weights are automatically downloaded when you specify them in your script. For example, to use the small model (yolov5s.pt), you don’t need to download it manually; it will be downloaded when you run the script.
Step 4: Prepare Your Dataset
Create or Download a Dataset:
If you don’t have a dataset, you can create one by taking photos of individual Uno cards against a plain background.
Annotate the images using tools like LabelImg.
Step 5: Train Your Model
Training Script:
Use the following command to train your model with your dataset:
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data custom.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt

Replace custom.yaml with the path to your dataset configuration file.
Step 6: Real-Time Detection with Webcam
Create a Detection Script:
Create a script named predict_card.py with the following content:
Python

import cv2
import torch

# Load the trained model
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', path='best.pt')

# Initialize webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Perform detection
    results = model(frame)

    # Display results
    cv2.imshow('Uno Card Detection', results.render()[0])

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
